I have been a developer for about 15 years. I primarily focus on .Net and am now moving further into the javascript ecosystem. I also do mobile development for the company I have the privilege of working for, {{< url-link "Mercury Network" "http://www.mercuryvmp.com/" >}}.

I am working on a couple small sites using Node.js and Angular 4. Once they are complete, they will be linked here.

I also enjoy too many hobbies including 3D printing, SCUBA diving, woodworking, brewing beer and am an Oklahoma Sooners fan.
