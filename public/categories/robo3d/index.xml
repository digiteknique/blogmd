      <description>Upgrading the printer I have enjoyed my Robo3D R1+ since Christmas 2015. It works really well and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had too many issues with it, but I was born a tinkerer. E3D recently came out with a few interesting things, the Titan extruder and the v6 hot end with a little silicone sleeve to keep the block clean. Well I obviously need this. I was also made aware of a new controller board gaining some traction, the Duet WiFi.</description>
