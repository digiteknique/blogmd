      <description>Upgrading the printer I have enjoyed my Robo3D R1+ since Christmas 2015. It works really well and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had too many issues with it, but I was born a tinkerer. E3D recently came out with a few interesting things, the Titan extruder and the v6 hot end with a little silicone sleeve to keep the block clean. Well I obviously need this. I was also made aware of a new controller board gaining some traction, the Duet WiFi.</description>

      <description>I have been a developer for about 15 years. I primarily focus on .Net and am now moving further into the javascript ecosystem. I also do mobile development for the company I have the privilege of working for, {{&amp;lt; url-link &amp;ldquo;Mercury Network&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;http://www.mercuryvmp.com/&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}.
I am working on a couple small sites using Node.js and AngularJS 2. Once they are complete, they will be linked here.
I also enjoy too many hobbies including 3D printing, SCUBA diving, woodworking, brewing beer and am an Oklahoma Sooners fan.</description>

      <description>I created this static site using {{&amp;lt; url-link &amp;ldquo;Hugo&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;http://gohugo.io/&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}. Hugo enables you to generate a very fast site using static pages.</description>
